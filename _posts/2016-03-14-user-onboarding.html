<blockquote>
<p><strong><i class="fa fa-trophy"></i> Goal</strong>: To increase user activation and engagement.</p>

<p><strong><i class="fa fa-bar-chart"></i> Measureable</strong>: Number of users completing several key activities within the program and mobile bounce rates.

<h2>The process:</h2>

<h3>Research</h3>


<p>We had access to pre-existing research from one-on-one interviews with this user group conducted by a customer engagement agency. I added to that some quantitive analytics data and a results of recent customer survey. I also spoke to our customer service team to understand any key pain points experienced by our users.</p>

<h3>Personas + User Stories</h3>

<p>Based on the research findings I prepared a primary and secondary persona. I created these in PowerPoint rather that graphic design software so it was easy for any project member to edit them. Then, as a team we took to the whiteboard to create user stories.</p>


<h3>Userflows</h3>

<p>I shared the current userflow (draw.io) and showed a screen by screen teardown to the project team. This made it easier to see where we could simplify the process, incorporate new steps our personas would want and highlighted some inconsistencies in the end to end visual design experience.</p>

<h3>Sketching + Wireframing + Prototyping</h3>

</div>


<p>I produced a number of layout sketches, wireframes and both static and rapid html prototypes for the on-boarding steps and the userâ€™s dashboard. I used a combination of paper pencil, photoshop, InVision, Balsamiq and CodePen.</p>


<h3>Testing</h3>

<p>In teams of two (one facilitator, one scribe) I ran several one on one user tests on our dashboard prototype and based on some recurrent findings iterated on the designs. We also used screen recording software to view users interacting with the changes as we implemented them in stages. This meant we were able to correct problem areas as we went.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Initial results show an increase on the previous months activation results and a decrease in bounce rates for mobile users.</p>
