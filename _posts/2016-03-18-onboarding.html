		<h2>Defining the problem</h2>

		<p>My first step was to define the problem I was trying to solve. I looked at existing data and filled in any gaps with extra research. I had findings from <strong>user interviews</strong> conducted by a customer engagement agency and added to that some <strong>quantitive analytics</strong> data around <strong>drop off points in the user onboarding funnel</strong> and the results of recent <strong>customer survey</strong>. I also spoke to our <strong>customer service team</strong> to understand any key pain points experienced by our users and prepared <strong>onboarding teardowns</strong> of our product and competitor products for reference.</p>

			<h2>User flows</h2>

			<figurecaption>
				<p>I documented both the current and proposed user flows for parents first trialling the software. I used draw.io to create the user flows and used Invision to show the existing screens and any accompanying emails the parent receives when first signing up to use the software.</p>

			<h2>Personas</h2>

				<p>Based on the user research I prepared a primary and secondary persona to share with the project team and help inform our design decisions.</p>

			<h2>Prototypes</h2>
			<img class="has-caption" src="/assets/folio/pd-prototype.png" />
			<figurecaption>
				<p>I created a number of prototypes through this process using sketches, balsamiq, Invision and finally HTML + CSS. I used prototypes to test critical and potentially difficult parts of the process and created a responsive prototype to help the team make some important layout and design decisions, that can be hard to make when reviewing a static design.</p>

			<h2>Walkthroughs</h2>
			<img class="has-caption" src="/assets/folio/pd-walkthrough.png" />
			<figurecaption>
				<p>I prepared prototype walkthroughs showing new users some of the key features of their interface and the software their children would be using. I created these using photoshop mockups inserted into powerpoint so our copywriter and marketing teams were able to edit the documents easily themselves.</p>
