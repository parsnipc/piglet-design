<h2>The Brief</h2>

<p>AWCH WA (Association for the Wellbeing of Children in Healthcare) needed a new website to better accomodate the need of their members.</p>

<h2>My role</h2>

<p>I designed and developed the site to better suit AWCH WA's members. The original site had a difficult to navigate and had no way for subscribers to signup online.</p>
