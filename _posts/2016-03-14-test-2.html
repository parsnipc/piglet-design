<h2>The Brief</h2>

<p>Headland Park Fitness is a Mosman gym and they were rebranding from Over Forty Fitness. They  wanted to attract a wider age range while retaining the relaxed and welcoming atmosphere the gym was known for.</p>

<p>A key feature of the gym is its fabulous location in Headland Park, a Harbour Trust managed business park and artist precinct near Sydney Harbourâ€™s Middle Head. The site is green and leafy with ocean views.</p>

<h2>My role</h2>

<p>I designed a new brand identity including logo, marketing collateral and stationery as well a design and build of a custom wordpress website.</p>
